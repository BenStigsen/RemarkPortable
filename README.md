### How-To-Use

1. Write your markdown in the `<textarea>`, in `index.html`
2. ... That's pretty much it... now you just open `index.html` in a browser and it should work.

For customization you can change the `style.css` file, or take a look at the **[Remark Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Formatting)**
